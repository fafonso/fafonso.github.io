Great news! a fresh new version of our [Liferay Quick VM Setup project](https://github.com/fafonso/liferay-puppet-vm) is now available!

Powered by Vagrant + Puppet, this project will allow you to rampup a **VM running Liferay DXP** from scratch, with all the required dependencies.

Some of the major changes for this new version are:

- Added Liferay Portal 7 CE GA3 by default (Liferay 6.2 CE has a new branch now and can still be used); 
- Java 8;
- New option to install external services as OpenOffice and ImageMagick;
- Apache2 with configuration for compression;
- Several minor bugfixes and improvements.

As a final note, if by any chance you will be by **Bratislava (19th October) or Prague (20th October)** and you want to **learn more about Liferay DXP**, you can't miss **[this event](http://www.mimacom.sk/liferay-dxp-cee#webinars)**. I'll be one of the speakers and we'll be showing the great potential of Liferay DXP. I hope to see you there!

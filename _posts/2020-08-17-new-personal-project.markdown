Hey everyone, it has been a while! But I feel that this blog post is long overdue =) 

Given the current context that we are living in, with all the concerns and challenges we are facing, there are loads of reasons to be stressed and concerned. 

But as usual, crises and threads also bring new opportunities, opportunities to do something different, something new and innovative. Something that could help to keep you going and mentally sane. I would like to encourage everyone to find their own personal projects or hobby that can be this small sparkle of light in your life, and maybe bring you something new. 

On this note, and to give you some inspiration, let me share with you my new personal project, that you can find on this [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiO-K4xRB82ToJt9PK3x_EA).

I've been playing [chromatic accordion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_button_accordion) for more than 20 years, and it represents a big and important part of my life. So I've decided to start sharing my little knowledge about it with the world, with the goal to spread some of the Portuguese traditional folk music (don't worry, I also have other styles of music there), helping other accordionists to learn some new tunes and most importantly, entertain the audience!

I truly hope you enjoy the channel and my music, and if so, please don't forget to **subscribe the channel**.

Thank you so much and see you soon!

In this post I will talk about how you can easily get a development environment with everything you need to run and test your Jekyll site, and all in an isolated VM, how cool is that?!

Long story short, during my adventure to build this site and learn about how to work with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), I felt the need to have my own development environment to check my changes and blog posts before send them live to [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/). At the same time, I was playing around with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) and voil√†! I started to work on a project to get a Vagrant VM, using Puppet to  configure everything you need to build and serve you Jekyll site.

All you need to do is to get the project **[here](https://github.com/fafonso/Jekyll-puppet-vm)** and include it in your Jekyll project. Quick notes about that:

- The GitHub readme file of the project will help you setting things up;
- If you are not familiar with Vagrant, it is a good idea to go through this [tuturial](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/);

Don't miss other cool things I've discovered and some good resources about Jekyll in my [previous blog post]({% post_url 2015-09-13-jekyll-and-more %}).

I hope that you've found this information useful and have fun!

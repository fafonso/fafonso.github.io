It is happening and is powered by Liferay!!! 

**14th July 2016** - Save the date 

We are working and giving our best to setup a fantastic evening for you all, with an amazing Java meetup here in Dublin, with interesting talks, pizza and some beer :)

I'll be talking about what you can achieve with configuration management tools like Vagrant and Puppet in your daily work as a developer or consultant.

Feel free to join us, I'm sure it will be an funny evening. More details **[here](http://www.meetup.com/Java-Meetup-Dublin/events/232211142/)** 

Looking forward to see you there!

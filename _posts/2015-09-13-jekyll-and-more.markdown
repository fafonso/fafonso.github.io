During the process of building this site, I've found some good resources and learned about some interesting technologies which I want to share with you here as it can be a good starting point for you:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) - Good tutorial to start learning about building your blog using **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll**
- [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) - Great Jekyll themes collection
- [Mediator Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/mediator/) - Great theme by Dirk Fabisch!
- [Easy Development Environment](https://github.com/fafonso/Jekyll-puppet-vm) - Project that uses **[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)** and **[Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/)** to easily get a VM with Jekyll and everything you need to get your development environment

Hope this post can point you in the right direction to learn a little bit more about Jekyll and some related technologies.

Have fun and see you soon!

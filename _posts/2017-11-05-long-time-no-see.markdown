I know it has been a long time since my last blog post, but the truth is that it has been a crazy year with so many things happening that I haven't been able to invest any time to write about anything.

Anyway, now everything is settling down and getting back to normality, and as so, I'm hoping to have time to share with you some cool ideas that I've been cooking, as I'm doing some experiments with **Liferay + WeDeploy + AI + OCR**.

In the meanwhile, let me share with you some of the work that I've been doing throughout this year.

1) I've done a **webinar series about Liferay DXP**, covering topics like cloud, dockers, mobile first approach, intranets and upgrades. You can find these webinars here:
- [Webinar 1](https://www.liferay.com/events?marketingEventId=231606513)
- [Webinar 2](https://www.liferay.com/events?marketingEventId=231606515)
- [Webinar 3](https://www.liferay.com/events?marketingEventId=231606516)
- [Webinar 4](https://www.liferay.com/events?marketingEventId=231606534)

2) I've also done my first talk in a conference ever! Me and my coleague Carlos Hernandez talked in **[Liferay Decon 2017](https://www.liferay.com/web/events-devcon) about Liferay DXP + Machine Learning** working togheter. It was a great experience and you can find our talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEncGotvTZk).

And that's it! I'll try hard to come back to blogging again with interesting topics and ideas to share with you guys. See you soon ;)
